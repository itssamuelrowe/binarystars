In this section we will discuss the brief history of Java.

Java was originally developed for an interactive TV. Java was developed by James
Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, at Sun Microsystems. They were known
as the Green Team.

It was initially called *Oak*, named after the oak tree outside Gosling's office.
It was then renamed to *Java* because *Oak* was already a trademark of Oak
Technologies.

Sun released Java 1.0 on the 23rd of January 1996. It promised *"Write Once, Run Anywhere"* (WORA).
