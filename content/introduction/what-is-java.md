Java is a programming language. It was created at Sun Microsystems. It was initially
released in 1995.

Java is similar to C and C++. So, if you have any experience with C or C++, you
will find Java easy to learn. However, Java is different in many significant
ways.

According to Oracle (which acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010), Java now runs on
more than 3 billion devices. Java powers millions of applications across multiple
platforms.

Some of the types of applications that run on Java are as follows:
    
### Desktop GUI Applications

Java provides GUI development through various frameworks such as Abstract Windowing
Toolkit (AWT), Swing and JavaFX.

### Mobile Applications

 Applications for Android, one of the most popular mobile operating system,
 are usually written in Java using the Android Software Development Kit (SDK).

### Embedded Systems

Several embedded devices, such as SIM cards, blue-ray disk players, utility
meters and televisions, use embedded Java technologies. According to Oracle,
more than 125 million TV devices are powered by Java.

### Web Applications

Java supports web applications through J2EE, which includes servlets,
Java Server Pages (JSP), and Java Persistence API (JPA).

The highly secured
environment offered by Java has allowed thousands of applications ranging
from health, social security, education and insurance based web applications
to be written in Java.

### Scientific Applications
  Large amounts of data, known as Big Data, can be efficiently processed
  with frameworks such as Hadoop. Such environments make Java a popular
  choice for many applications involving scientific calculations and mathematical
  operations.
