In this lecture, we'll discuss about the disadvantages of Java.

Like any programming language, Java is not perfect.

 * Performance 
 
 Java programs are converted to bytecodes when compiled. During execution, these
 byte codes are interpreted by the virtual machine. Thus, Java programs take
 longer time to run compared to programs written in C and C++. But this problem is being overcome
 with a Just-in-time Compiler (JIT).

 * Consumes More Memory
  
 This is one of the biggest problems in Java. Java takes more memory space than the
 other native programming languages like C and C++. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
 stores metadata about classes and other objects in the background. This causes
 your programs to consume more memory.

 * Garbage collection
 
 You have no control over garbage collection in Java. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
 takes care of everything for you. Sometimes this is not what you want.
