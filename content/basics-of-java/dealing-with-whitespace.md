Whitespace refers to a sequence of space characters, tab characters, or line
breaks. The compiler always ignores whitespace.

Here's an example.

```
area = 2 * (width + breadth);
```

You can write this statement on two lines.

Thus, you can write the  example statement like this.

```
area =
    (width + breadth);
```

In fact, you can write the example statement like this, too.

```
area
=
(
width
+
breadth
)
;
```

Yet, another variation.

```
area
    =
        width
            +
                breadth
                    )
                        ;
```

I wouldn't advise such writing styles. But the statements will compile and execute correctly.

Use whitespace freely in your programs. In particular, follow these tips whenever possible:
    * Use line breaks to write each statement on separate lines.
    * Use whitespace to indent statements neatly. It helps you read your source code easily.
