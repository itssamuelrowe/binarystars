Statements are similar to sentences in the English language.

A statement tells Java to perform an action. It can include one or more *expressions*.

There are two types of statements in Java:
    * Simple Statement
    * Compound Statement

## Understanding Simple Statements

Simple statements are the actions your program performs.

* Assertion Statement
* Break Statement
* Continue Statement
* Empty Statement
* Expression Statement
* Return Statement and
* Throw Statement

 * A simple statement always ends with a semicolon.
 * The example shown here is an expression statement. Therefore, it is
   *terminated* with a semicolon.
   
```
   System.out.println("Hello, world!");
```

## Understanding Compound Statements

Compound statements help you group simple statements and control them.

* Block Statement
* Do-While Statement
* For Statement
* If Statement
* Switch Statement
* Synchronized Statement
* Try Statement and
* While Statement

 * A compound statement does not require a semicolon.
 * An exception to this is the Do-While Statement.
 * Compound statements are usually associted with blocks.
