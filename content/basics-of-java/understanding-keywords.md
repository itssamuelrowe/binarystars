A *keyword* is a special word. Its meaning is defined by the Java programming
language. **You cannot use these words as identifiers**.

All keywords are in lowercase.

Like everything else in Java, keywords are case sensitive. For example, if you
use `For` with uppercase f instead of `for` with lowercase f it is an error.

The program shown in the [first example](/academy/tutorial/java-programming-language/basics-of-java/the-hello-world-program) 
uses four keywords.
    * `public`
    * `class`
    * `static` and
    * `void`

In Java there are 51 keywords. They’re listed in alphabetical order here.

| | | | | |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|------------|--------|
| abstract       | assert       | boolean   | break      | byte   |
| case           | catch        | char      | class      | const  |
| continue       | default      | do        | double     | else   |
| enum           | extends      | final     | finally    | float  |
| for            | if           | goto      | implements | import |
| instanceof     | int          | interface | long       | native |
| new            | package      | private   | protected  | public |
| return         | short        | static    | strictfp   | super  |
| switch         | synchronized | this      | throw      | throws |
| transient      | try          | void      | volatile   | while  |
| _ (underscore) |              |           |            |        |

Some words are sometimes, incorrectly, assumed as keywords. In any case, they’re reserved in the same way as keywords.

 * The keywords `const` and `goto` are reserved. They are not used.
 * `true` and `false` are not keywords. They are boolean literals.
 * `null` is not a keyword. It indicates the null literal.
 * `var` is not a keyword. It is a special identifier.
