In this section, you will learn about the Java Documentation.

The Java API has thousands of classes, interfaces, enumerations, methods, and
fields. These prewritten classes provide a powerful functionality to you.
You should be aware of these classes and should know how to use them.

It is impossible for normal people to remember the names and functionality of all 
these components. When you want to know the details of a component, you can
simply refer to the Java documentation. It is a complete listing of all classes
in the Java API. You can find it at Oracle's website.

You can find the Java documentation here.
