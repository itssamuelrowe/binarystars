You can determine the length of a string using the `length()` method. The length
of a string is basically the number of characters it contains.

Here is an example which prints the length of a string.

```
String name = "Shazam";
int length = name.length();
System.out.println(length);
```

The length of a string is an imoprtant value when you want to manipulate strings.
