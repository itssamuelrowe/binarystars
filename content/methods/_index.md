In Java all programs are built with classes, which means there is at least
one class. Further, every program must have at least one method, the `main()`
method. That's it. Beyond that, you don't need to create other methods.
But, without methods, often your code will contain a lot of duplicate instructions.

In this chapter, you will learn how to create your own methods, invoking methods,
accepting parameters, and finally returning values from methods.
