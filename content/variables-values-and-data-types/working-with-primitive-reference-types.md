In this section, you will learn about the basics of reference types.
You learn to create variables that work with objects.
> You will learn more about classes and objects later in the course.

Java programs are built with classes. You can use classes to create objects.

A reference type is a type which references an object. 

The class can be any class. It can either be a part of the Java API or a
class that you create.

When you create an object, you allocate memory to store the object. Here's an
example of how you can create an object.
```
new Object()
```

When you store the object in a variable, you assign a *reference* to the object.
You don't store the object itself.

A reference is the location of an object in memory. References are similar to
pointers in C or C++. Unlike pointers, references are simple and easy to use.

For example, think that you’re writing a program which involves cars.
You have a class named `Car` which defines the behavior of a car.
You can declare a variable that stores a reference to a `Car` object like
this.
```
Car car;
```

Here, the variable `car` is of type `Car`. Remember that Java is case sensitive.
Which means Car with an uppercase C and car with a lowercase c are different.

To create a new *instance* of a class, you can use the `new` keyword. You have
to tell `new` the class whose instance you want.

When you create an instance of a class, you actually call a *constructor*.
The constructor initializes the new object.

> them when you learn about them in detail.

Here's an example where we create an instance of the class `Car`.
```
new Car()
```

You can assign a reference to the new object.
```
Car car;
car = new Car();
```

You can combine both these statements like this.
```
Car car = new Car();
```

Remember that a reference variable doesn’t actually store an object.
It stores only the reference to an object in memory. As a result, two or more
variables can refer to the same object.

Here's an example where two variables refer to the same `Car` object.
```
Car carX = new Car();
Car carY = carX;
```

Here, we've declared two `Car` variables, named `carX` and `carY`. But we've
created only one `Car` object.

We first created a `Car` object and assigned its reference to `carX`. Then
the same reference is assigned to `carY`. This way, both `carX` and `carY`
refer to the same object.
