In this section, we'll learn how to convert a value from one type to
another type.

There are times when you need to convert a value of one type to another.
In such cases, you use *type casting*. Converting a value from one type to
another type is known as *type casting*. For example, you can convert a decimal
value to an integer value, or vice versa.

There are two types of casting in Java.

 * Implicit Casting
 * Explicit Casting

In some cases, values are automatically converted for you. Such conversions
are known as *implicit casting*. In other cases, you have to convert the values.
Such conversions are known as *explicit casting*.
