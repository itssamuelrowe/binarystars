The unary plus and minus operators let you change the sign of an operand.

Note that the symbol used to represent these operators are the same as the addition and subtraction operators.
The compiler figures out which operation you mean by examining the expression.

Remember, the unary minus operator doesn't necessarily make an operand negative. Actually, it inverts the sign
of the operand. For example, assume x = -5 then -x will give
you 5.

Mathematically, this is equivalent to -x = x * -1.

Interestingly, the unary plus operator does not actually
do anything. For example, assume x = -5 and y = 7 then
+x and +y will give you -5 and 7, respectively.

Mathematically, this is equivalent to +x = x * 1.
