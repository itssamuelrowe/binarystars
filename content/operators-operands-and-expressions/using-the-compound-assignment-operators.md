A compound assignment operator is an operator that performs both an implicit calculation and an assignment.

Here's a list of all the compound assignment operators for the arithmetic operators.

| Operator | Description                             |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| +=       | Addition and assignment                 |
| -=       | Subtraction and assignment              |
| *=       | Multiplication and assignment           |
| /=       | Division (for quotient) and assignment  |
| %=       | Division (for remainder) and assignment |

For example, the statement `a = a + 10` can be written as `a += 10`.

Here's another exampe. The statement `b = b * 100` can be written as `b *= 100`.

Compound assignment operators can be confusing when used in complex expressions. Therefore, we recommend you to always compound
assignment operators by themselves.
