All if statements, as well as several other control statements that you
learn in this book use boolean expressions to determine whether to execute
or skip a segment of your code.

A boolean expression is any expression that evaluates to a
boolean value, that is, true or false.

As you discover later in this chapter, boolean expressions can be very
complicated. Most of the time you use simple expressions that
compare a value with some other value. This comparison uses one of the
relational operators. You can use logical operators to combine the
comparisons.

The various relational operators and their descriptions are listed in
the following table. All these operators are binary operators, which means
that they work on two operands.

The various logical operators and their descriptions are listed in the
following table. All these operators, except the logical NOT operator,
are binary. The logical NOT operator is a unary operator and accepts
one operand.

We have covered both the relational and logical operators in detail in the
previous chapter. You can always go back and revise when you have doubts.
