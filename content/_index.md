### Why is this topic important?

Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the
world. In fact, more than seven billion devices run the Java
Runtime Environment worldwide. Java was designed with
portability, flexibility and security in mind. You can write programs
that can run on most platforms, without having to change a single
line of code making Java a powerful tool. Thousands of
applications are written in Java, especially in the enterprise and
scientific community.
