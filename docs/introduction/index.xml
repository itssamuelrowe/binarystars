      <description>Java is a programming language. It was created at Sun Microsystems. It was initially released in 1995.
Java is similar to C and C++. So, if you have any experience with C or C++, you will find Java easy to learn. However, Java is different in many significant ways.
According to Oracle (which acquired Sun Microsystems in 2010), Java now runs on more than 3 billion devices. Java powers millions of applications across multiple platforms.</description>

      <description>In this section we will discuss the brief history of Java.
Java was originally developed for an interactive TV. Java was developed by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, at Sun Microsystems. They were known as the Green Team.
It was initially called Oak, named after the oak tree outside Gosling&amp;rsquo;s office. It was then renamed to Java because Oak was already a trademark of Oak Technologies.
Sun released Java 1.</description>

      <description>In this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss about the advantages of Java.
Java is Simple Java is easy to learn and use.
If you know the basics of Object Oriented Programming, you can easily learn Java.
Java is Platform Independent One of the main reasons Java is so popular is its platform independence, which means Java programs can run on many types of computers. In other words, applications written on one platform can be easily ported to another platform.</description>

      <description>In this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss about the disadvantages of Java.
Like any programming language, Java is not perfect.
 Performance  Java programs are converted to bytecodes when compiled. During execution, these byte codes are interpreted by the virtual machine. Thus, Java programs take longer time to run compared to programs written in C and C++. But this problem is being overcome with a Just-in-time Compiler (JIT).
 Consumes More Memory   This is one of the biggest problems in Java.</description>

      <description>In this section, we will compare Java to C and C++. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn about their differences.
Paradigm Both Java and C++ are Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages. Whereas, C is Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) language.
Memory Management All programming languages let you handle data. When you create a variable, you can assign a portion of the computer&amp;rsquo;s memory to store the data. The allocation of memory is a detail that you can usually ignore.</description>
